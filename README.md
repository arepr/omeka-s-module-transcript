# Vimeo: Omeka S module

In a freshly-installed Omeka S setup, Vimeo videos can be embedded via oEmbed. This module builds on that functionality by providing an interactive transcript UI and ingesting higher resolution thumbnails.

## Installation

Use the zipped releases provided on GitHub for a standard install.

You may also clone the git repository, rename the folder to `VimeoEmbed`, and build from source with `composer install --no-dev`.

## Interoperability

This module is compatible with the [CSVImport](https://github.com/omeka-s-modules/CSVImport) and [AmazonS3](https://github.com/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-AmazonS3) modules.

## License

This module uses a GPLv3 license.
