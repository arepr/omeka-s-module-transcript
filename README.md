# Vimeo: Omeka S module

In a freshly-installed Omeka S setup, Vimeo videos can be embedded via oEmbed. This module builds on that functionality by providing an interactive transcript UI and ingesting higher resolution thumbnails.

## Installation

Use the zipped releases provided on GitHub for a standard install.

You may also clone the git repository, rename the folder to `VimeoEmbed`, and build from source with `composer install --no-dev`.

## License

This module uses a GPLv3 license.
